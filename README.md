# ðŸ’¤ My LazyVim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/).  
I use it to keep my dev setup in sync across different devices (macOS, Windows, etc).

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- LazyVim base config
- TypeScript & JavaScript LSP (tsserver)
- Prettier formatting on save
- ESLint integration
- Telescope fuzzy search
- Neo-tree file explorer (shows dotfiles)
- Git integration (LazyGit)
- Basic quality-of-life keymaps

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (on a new machine)

1. Install [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (v0.9+ recommended)
2. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lazyvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
